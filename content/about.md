I'm a technologist, logician and avid lifelong learner. I love technology platforms, open source and improving our planet for everyone and everything.

Residing just outside of London, UK, I am a Partner Technology Strategist at Microsoft. That is, I help Microsoft's partner ecosystem shape their technology roadmaps and build new products, solutions and services centred on cloud platforms.

Concurrently I am studying for a [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

Beyond working and studying, you can often find me hitting the roads in my Nike ~Lunarglide's~ Air Zoom Pegasus', practising mindfulness, reading and learning as much as I can. In addition, I like (or at least attempt) to come up with solutions to issues regarding [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) and [social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility) facing the world today.

This website will mostly be a collection of my thoughts, stories and ideas relating to any of these topics.
