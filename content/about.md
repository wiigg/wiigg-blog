My name is Danny Wigg, a.k.a "wiigg", and I'm a technologist, [logician](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) and avid lifelong learner. I love technology platforms, open source and improving our planet for everyone and everything.

Residing just outside of London, UK, I am a Partner Technology Strategist at Microsoft. That is, I help Microsoft's partner ecosystem shape their technology roadmaps and build new products, solutions and services on top of cloud platforms such as [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

Concurrently, I am studying part-time for a [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

Beyond working and studying, you can often find me hitting the road in my Nike Air Zoom Pegasus', practising mindfulness, reading and learning new things. In addition, I like (or at least attempt) to come up with solutions to the [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) challenges facing the world today.

This website will mostly be a collection of my thoughts, stories and ideas relating to any of these topics.

Want to chat? I'm always up for meeting up over a coffee or cup of tea! [Get in touch](https://twitter.com/wiigg).
