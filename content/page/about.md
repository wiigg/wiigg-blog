I'm a technologist, avid lifelong learner and logician. I love open source, technology platforms and improving our planet for everyone and everything.

Currently residing in the UK, I work at Microsoft as a Technology Strategist. There, I help Microsoft's network of partners shape and build new products, solutions and services centred on Azure and Microsoft 365. But my primary focus is Azure.

Previously, I was a Technology Advocate at Hewlett Packard Enterprise where I founded a team that curated strategic alliances with technology companies across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Together we created new solutions which generated value for some of the largest organisations in the world and in turn, thousands of people. There's a high chance you interact with some of them in daily life without even realising.

The rest of my background can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannywigg/).

Outside of work, you can often find me hitting the road in my Nike Lunarglide's, practising mindfulness, reading (probably something to do with tech or economics), and studying topics in mathematics, computer science oder Deutsch! In addition, I'm passionate about conserving the environment and reducing inequality through meritocratic opportunity.

This blog will mostly be a collection of my thoughts, stories and ideas relating to any of these topics.

Want to chat? I'm always up for a coffee or cup of tea! [Get in touch](https://twitter.com/wiigg).
